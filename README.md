In December 2019, the world witnessed an aweful outbreak of [coronavirus disease](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) in China. Not a long time later, it has been spread in more than 100 countries. No vaccine is currently available!

One underrated way of minimizing spreading the virus and protecting ourselves from it is to **wear a mask**.

MasKorona utilizes Artificial Intelligence to distinguish mask-covered vs non-covered faces. MasKorona can be used in surveillance cameras in streets, offices, or crowded places such as supermarkets.
